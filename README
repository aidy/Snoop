### BurpBot ###
Irc bot i have been working on over the last few months based on the cinch frame work

### Features ###
+ Runs a webserver and can print message into channels using the rest api (good for nagios live alerting)
+ Has a plugin to poll multiple nagios servers 
+ Can be setup to watch redmine projects and output info into channel
+ Can use all google search (images, videos, web, etc)
+ Urban dict support
+ Many others

### Writing Plugins ###
Branch and write, in order to have the plugin autoload add to plugins dir and have the class extend  CinchPlugin,
add the help line and give me a merge request. 
You can also have background worker threads if you add them to the threads dir and have the class extend CinchThread.

### Test ###
I have a few, please use vcr so that you don't have to hit the network.
